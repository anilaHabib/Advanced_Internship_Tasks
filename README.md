## ðŸ“Š Task 2: Climate Change Impact on Global Food Supply

**Objective:**  
To explore and analyze how climate change variables like COâ‚‚ emissions and temperature anomalies impact global food supply trends.

**Key Steps:**
- Loaded and cleaned real-world climate and food production datasets
- Handled missing values and performed data merging
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using pandas and seaborn
- Visualized trends and correlations to identify insights

**Tools & Libraries:**  
`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `numpy`

## ðŸ”Œ Task 3: Energy Consumption Time Series Forecasting

**Objective:**  
To forecast future household energy usage based on historical power consumption data.

**Dataset Used:**  
Household Power Consumption Dataset (Kaggle - 240,000+ records)

**Techniques Applied:**
- Parsed and resampled time series data
- Engineered time-based features
- Applied and compared models like:
  - ARIMA
  - Facebook Prophet
  - XGBoost

**Evaluation Metrics:**  
MAE, RMSE, Accuracy (where applicable)

**Tools & Libraries:**  
`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `statsmodels`, `prophet`, `xgboost`, `sklearn`
